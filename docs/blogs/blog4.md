# Response to Gurjaap's Blog Post

In their blog post, Gurjaap talks about their experience interning at Amazon and struggling with their code because of the lack of specific error messages the codebase provides. At the end of their post, Gurjaap talks about how it can be difficult to understand why you would need very specific error messages when you’re working on a smaller project, but as the project scales it becomes very necessary.

This reminded me of some of my own experience writing poor code that becomes very cumbersome as it scales in complexity. In the moment, it can feel time saving to write a quick hacky solution to a problem or not bother writing detailed documentation or a descriptive error message. This can feel true because as you are working on a problem, it is at the forefront of your mind and so the extra work can seem unnecessary. However as time goes on and the complexity of your project increases, you will inevitably forget how parts of your code are working and these “time saves” will actually increase the overall time you will take trying to debug issues with your code. In Gurjaaps case, this was especially true as new people who were unfamiliar with the codebase were trying to understand how it works. This idea goes back to the 6.031 principals of the importance of writing code that is (1) Safe From Bugs (2) Easy to Understand and (3) Ready for Change.
