# Needfinding

## Hunch

I would like to design a social media app that acts as a space where music hobbyists can learn from and collaborate with one another. There exist some other online spaces for learning music, such as Youtube tutorials or Ultimate Guitar tabs, but I would like to create an app that centers more around community and collaboration.

## Who to Interview and Why

My target audience is people who are learning music for fun and self-teaching themself skills. I would find it useful to interview people who have studied music on their own and can help me understand what resources they felt were useful, frustrating, or lacking. It would also be helpful to interview people who can tell me about their experiences using different social media platforms, and specifically what they’ve personally found inspiring/motivating from social media. For these reasons, I've chosen to interview the following people:

1. **Sean**

   Sean is a former high school teacher, summer camp leader, and now a PhD student at the MIT Media Lab. His lab group "LifeLong Kindergarden" does a lot work around creative learning. He has an extensive musical background, playing many instruments like guitar, piano, trombone, and banjo and has been a part of many bands. He is now very involved in a local music school here called the School of HONK!, which is a free and open community band. From this program, Sean has a lot of experience playing, teaching, and collaborating on music with others.

2. **Ian**

   Ian is a researcher at Boston Children's Hospital, working as a data scientist. He is not part of any bands/performances, but enjoys playing music as a hobby in his free time. He plays both piano and guitar, and much of his musical knowledge and skills are self-taught. He enjoys learning new songs and playing music with others. He is also a frequent social media user, often using platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

## Guiding Interview Questions

I split my questions into two sections. The first section was to learn about their general background, interests, and use of social media. The second was to learn about their music experience.

### General Life and Social Media Questions

1. Can you tell me a bit about yourself, like what you do for work and what you do in your free time?
2. What social media apps do you use? How regularly do you use them?
3. Why do you use these apps, for instance what features do you use or what kind of content do you consume?
4. Have you ever used social media to learn a specific skill or about a specific topic? If so, what has this experience been like?
5. Can you remember a time when you felt inspired by something you saw on social media? Did you do anything in response to this?
6. How do you feel social media impacts you? Do you feel like after using social media, it has a positive or negative effect on the rest of your day?

### Music-specific Questions

1. Can you briefly describe your background as a musician or music hobbyist? What prompted you to get interested in music, and what instruments do you play?
2. What motivates you to keep learning or practicing music?
3. What resources do you use to learn new songs or improve your skills? What about these resources have you personally found the most helpful?
4. What kind of music do you listen to and how do you find new music that you like?
5. How do you find new songs you want to learn how to play?
6. What kind of content (if any) related to music do you consume on social media? Why does this content interest you?
7. Have you ever taught music to others? How did you go about this?
8. Do you ever make music with other people? How did this work and what was this experience like?

## Interview Reports

Below are the reports from both of my two interviews. The raw interview notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/180iwMrJ78R1UZv_HQgdWdphMsgnUzdaHzYW_ZPo7Rsg/edit?usp=sharing).

### Interview Report #1: Sean

Sean is very passionate about music and has a very extensive musical background. We spent a lot of the interview discussing how he first got involved in music through lessons when he was young, and his journey to where he is now, being a part of a band in Providence, RI, and being involved in teaching at a local music school (called the school of HONK). One moment I found interesting from Sean’s interview was when he described his motivations for playing music. He talked about how when was taking lessons when he was younger, he was very not interested in them and “got to a point where my piano teacher basically like fired me” because he hadn’t been practicing regularly. Later in his life though, he discovered that “playing fun music in a group of people is the thing that motivates me [to keep learning and practicing]”. This point about how finding community was what motivated him made me feel more confident about following my “hunch” idea. In the interview, Sean also described a lot of different ways he’s learned and taught music, as well as different resources he’s used, which would be useful when designing my app.

In the social media part of our interview, Sean mentioned that he used to occasionally use twitter and facebook, but now he mainly just uses Instgram. One of the questions I asked was about how Sean felt his social media use impacted him, and if he felt if after using social media it had a positive or negative effect on the rest of his day. Sean shared how he often feels frustrated with how social media is designed with the goal to make people “never look away”. He mentioned the negative impacts of infinite scrolling, and how in his life he tries to take precautions on how he is using social media to avoid spending too much time on it.

### Interview Report #2: Ian

Ian is a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital, working as a data scientist. Though he isn’t a part of any formal bands or performances, Ian has an extensive music background and enjoys playing lots of guitar and piano at home. I found it interesting how he, like Sean, took music lessons when he was young but didn’t enjoy them, and also like Sean, he started enjoying music after he stopped taking lessons when he was learning on his own. After self-teaching himself a lot about music, Ian is now very proficient at both of these instruments and able to play most songs by ear. Something else interesting from our interview was how Ian described playing music collaboratively with others. I was curious about how this worked since he mentioned when playing with others, they would play together just for fun, without any planning or sheet music. Ian explained how he and a friend would sometimes sit and play piano together at the same time, or one of them would play piano while the other played guitar, and they would both just play the “same notes with the same chords” by ear. When asked what motivates him to learn and practice music, Ian described how it feels very relaxing for him. He particularly enjoys being able to play songs he’s practiced before, so he can just play them from muscle memory. He also explained how it feels very satisfying for him to be able to play a song and have it sound very similar to the recorded version, so he mainly chooses to play songs that only have one instrument in them. During the interview, Ian also described a lot of his process for finding and learning songs to play on these instruments, which I think will be helpful when thinking about what features to include in the design of my app.

Ian is also a frequent social media user and is often on TikTok and Instagram. He describes how he uses TikTok when he is bored, just scrolling through and watching funny memes as a way to “turn his brain off for a bit” and says he uses Instagram for knowing what his friends are up to (by scrolling through every day or two to see new updates). It seemed like he mainly used social media in a passive way, as a way to decompress. For my app though I’m curious about how people can learn new skills from social media, so as one of my interview questions I asked him about any new skills he’s learned or things he’s been inspired by from TikTok or Instagram. He did mention some music related things, for instance seeing posts of people playing songs and thinking maybe he could learn to play it too. He also mentioned a bunch of different random skills he’s learned (mainly from TikTok), for instance how to chop a bunch of tomatoes efficiently and how to create latte art. It seemed like there was a lot of variety in the type of content he was inspired by.

## Design Opportunities

1. **Ability for users to post video updates of a song or musical skill they are learning**

Both interviewees expressed how they found video posts by other people playing music inspiring for them. This feature would allow users to share their own progress on learning a skill or song, which could motivate others, who are just consuming content on the app, to learn. It would also provide a way for bands like Sean's to advertise upcoming performances they have, by posting a clip of their performance.

2. **Feature to link tabs, sheet music, or tutorials for a song included on a post**

The interviewees discussed some different resources they used for learning songs on their own. For instance, Ian discussed just looking at the guitar chords when he wanted to play a song, and Sean mentioned watching Youtube tutorials to learn specific skills. This indicates that different people would find different resources helpful in learning music. By letting a users link posts to different kinds of resources, this would others who find the post inspiring to have different suggested ways to get started.

3. **A way for users to react or "remix" a post made by another user**

   Both interviewees also talked about how they enjoyed and found it motivating to collaborate on music with others. This feature would allow users to do this in a virtual environment, where they could create another post by playing their own instrument alongside an original one to create a remixed version. Though this isn't simultaneous like the way Sean and Ian described their experience in collaborating on music, it would still be one method of collaborating in a virtual environment.
