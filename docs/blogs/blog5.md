In Matthew’s blog post, he describes some different “design failures” in Snapchat, Windows, and Yahoo, that have led to significant user-dissatisfaction. Annie builds upon some of these ideas in her response where she talks about the dangers of developers combining and simplifying things that are already working.

In reflecting on both of these posts, I started thinking about how incremental changes in a user-interface might help the users feel more adjusted to it and could decrease user-dissatisfaction. This could include a gradual integration of new features or an “opt-in” approach, where users could choose whether or not they want to tryout new features. One example of this I noticed when we were wireframing in Figma was our TA chose to turn on the new Figma interface setting. This setting changes the layout of the design tools on the page. For my own wireframing, I chose to coninue using the old layout because the placement of the tools made more sense to me. A benefit of this approach is that developers could see whether or not users are choosing to opt-in and if they are appreciating the new feature before deciding if they want to make a large-scale change.

Overall, I think this strategy creates a more user-centered design process because it is respecting user-habits and preferences. When the changes are small or voluntary, the users may feel more in control, reducing the pushback Matthew discusses in some of his examples. Additionally, it allows for more feedback from users before making large changes that could be disruptive.
