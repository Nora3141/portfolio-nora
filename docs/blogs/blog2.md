# Lecture 4 Blog Post - Similar Software Concepts

In this lecture, we talked about different software "concepts", and how we can explain them using their name, purpose, and operational principle. For my blog post, I wanted to explore some concepts we didn't discuss in class and look at how different websites can integrate the same software concept in different ways.

### 1: "Tagging"

**Purpose:** users can filter and identify items according to categories

**Operational Principle:** after attaching a tag to an item, when that tag category is accessed, the item will come up

Here are two different examples of tagging that I found. The first is a picture from Reddit, where users who make posts can choose to add a tag to them by selecting relevant tags from a set. This set is created by the moderators of a community on Reddit, and users who are posting within the community can only select tags from within it.

This second example is a picture from a post on Twitter/X. In this case, users are not choosing a tag from a set, but are instead allowed to write any sequence of characters to create the category (I believe within some character limit).

I think it's interesting how the difference in design choices for how these software concepts were integrated probably changes the way people feel they can express themselves on these two platforms.

### 2: "Favoriting"

**Purpose:** users can mark items to show that they appreciate them

**Operational Principle:** after favoriting an item, the item will be displayed to all users with an additional "favorite" mark of appreciation

Here were two different examples of favoriting that I found. This first picture is from Scratch (scratch.mit.edu). Here users can "favorite" projects by clicking the star or heart icon on the project. Scratch calls these icons "favorite" and "love". Personally I never understood why there were two different icons, but it allows users to mark their appreciation for a project in two different ways which they can decide on for themselves.

Here is a second example of favoriting that I found from Youtube. Here there is just one button with a thumbs-up icon users can click on to "favorite" a video. Similar to Scratch, there is a number right next to this icon to show how many users have favorited the project.

Similar to the "tagging" concept, I think its interesting how the design of the implementation for the favoriting icon changes the ways people can express themselves on the different websites. I also wonder about how the naming of these different features ("like", "favorite", and "love") changes the way people view them.
