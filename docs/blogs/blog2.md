# Divergent Design

## Broad Application Goals

**Name:** Allegro (meaning at a brisk, lively tempo in music)

**Intended Audience:** People who are interested in learning or playing music. Specifically, people who are music hobbyists who are just playing for fun and self-teaching themself skills.

**Value:** In existing music related apps, there exist features like suggesting songs to you based on your preferences, or giving you sheet music for how to play a song. I feel that there is a lack of community in these spaces which could further help and inspire people to learn. This app will focus more on community, and will exist as a space for the intended audience to share their own progress learning/playing music and to find help/inspiration from others in the community for what to learn next.

## Scrapbook of Comparables

Below are screenshots from different applications that have features that I think could be relevant to my design. Below the images are captions describing these features.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <img src="/../assets/images/spotify.png" alt="spotify homepage" style="width: 200px; margin: 10px;"/>
    <img src="/../assets/images/ultimate-guitar.png" alt="ultimate guitar homepage" style="width: 200px; margin: 10px;"/>
    <img src="/../assets/images/tiktok.png" alt="tiktok image" style="width: 208px; margin: 10px;"/>
</div>

**Left:** This is the homepage for Spotify. Could we have a similar interface for navigating between the home page, searching for a song, and seeing any saved posts you have? Also could we use a similar selector at the top instead of selecting between different kinds of media to select between instruments or music genres?

**Middle:** This is the homepage for Ultimate Guitar. I like how it features the search bar at the top, so its easy for users to find songs they're looking for, and I might want to include a similar search bar on my app. Similarly, I also like how they make relevant tabs easy to find for users by having the "Top 100" and "Spotify" buttons at the top of the page.

**Right:** This is a looking at a post on TikTok. Could we use a similar interface to let users swipe between posts on our app, as well as leave comments on them? I wonder if we could use a similar structure, but with an additional side button to also provide a place for users to link relevant tutorials or sheet music to their post.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <img src="/../assets/images/scratch-profile.png" alt="spotify homepage" style="width: 300px; margin: 10px;"/>
    <img src="/../assets/images/twitch.png" alt="spotify homepage" style="width: 400px; margin: 10px;"/>
</div>

**Left:** This is the profile page for Scratch (scratch.mit.edu). Could we include a profile page on the app, where users can similarly describe what kind of songs they are learning, skills they are working on, or performances they're going to be a part of? Could we also use the profile page of the app to let users access their "saved" posts, similar to how on scratch you can see projects you "favorited"?

**Right:** This is the page of a twitch livestream. Could we include a livestreaming feature on the app where people can perform music, and have a similar page structure with a section of the screen dedicated to the video footage, and a section for other users to type in a live chat to give comments/feedback?

## Brainstorming Feature Ideas

1. Can post video or audio clips of songs you are practicing
2. Can search for a song to see clips others posted of playing that song
3. Can click a button to find relevant tutorials or sheet music from a post
4. Can create collaborative playlists with other people, and see playlists other people make
5. Can save posts your interested in, so you can easily find them when you want to practice
6. Can enter music preferences to get suggested songs
7. Can connect your spotify account to get suggested songs
8. Can like and comment on other people's posts
9. Can post on your profile to advertise any upcoming performances you are a part of
10. Can follow accounts to get updates from them and song suggestions from the music they post
11. Can choose to livestream playing music
12. Can have a "tutorial library" of written or video tutorials others post for learning skills/songs
13. Can "duet" or "remix" another person's post (adding yourself playing music along side them)
14. Can post multiple "progress updates" on learning one specific skill or song
15. Can have an AI feature to tell you what chords it thinks is being played in a post
16. Can watch a post in slow playback mode for practicing
17. Can see what posts are currently trending to find relevant posts
18. Can filter posts in your feed by their instrument, genre, difficulty of playing, or other categories
19. Can add tags to your own posts so that they get recognized by the filtering system
20. Can create a description on your profile to share what you're currently learning or playing

## VSD Analysis

### Insight 1: Indirect Stakeholders

**Observation:**
Three indirect stakeholders of the app could be (1) Music artists whose songs users are playing and posting their own versions of. These people might be concerned about not getting proper credit for their music. (2) People in the background of recorded videos. These people might not have realized they were getting recorded, and did not want to be posted online. (3) Parents of young people using the app. They might be concerned about what kind of content their child is posting online and might want more control over it.

**Design Modifications:**
A modification I could make for the music artists could be to add a feature where you must enter the original artist/band name in order to create a post. For people in the background of recorded videos, one approach could be to alert the user before they start recording to check the environment around them before they record, and remind them that they must get permission from anyone in the recording to post it. For the parents of young people using the app, one feature that could help with this is to allow parental controls for young users. These controls could let them disable/enable posting on the account, or make it only visible to certain people.

### Insight 2: Long-Term Health and Well-Being

**Observation:**
The main purpose of the app is to have a space that encourages/inspires people to learn music. Some ways it could influence well-being are (1) positively - inspiring people to learn music, and they learn a new skill/find a new hobby they enjoy (2) negatively - instead of feeling motivated to learn music, users just scroll on the feed for long periods of time which could negatively impact their well-being (3) positively - people who are passionate about music can find a community of other like-minded people.

**Design Modifications:**
One way I could reduce the negative impact on a user that scrolls in the feed for a long time, is to put a limit on how many posts a user can view (in some time frame) before the feed stops supplying new posts. When this limit is reached, the app could use a message to encourage the to instead of scrolling, to search up a song in the search bar to learn.

### Insight 3: Crossing National Boundaries

**Observation:**
If the app were to be used in other countries, probably different kinds of posts would start being made, for instance, posts where users are playing different instruments. Also, for people in other countries, they might not understand any written English text in the app (for example, in a tutorial).

**Design Modifications:**
The different kinds of posts being made would require adding new categories of filters. One solution to this could be to allow users to suggest new filter categories to get added to the app. For users that don’t understand English, there could either be a lot of universally understood icons in the app, or a way to translate all the text in the app to a different language.

### Insight 4: Choose Desired Values

**Observation:**
Three desired values of this app are (1) community - users should be able to share the songs their learning with friends + others, get feedback from other people, and see what songs/skills other people are interested in (2) learning - users should be encouraged/enabled to learn new musical skills through the app and (3) collaboration - users should be encouraged to collaborate with others when learning music through the app

**Design Modifications:**
To further promote collaboration, I could include features like remixing other people’s posts or creating shared playlists with other users (of songs or saved posts). To further promote community, I could allow users to join groups specific to genres, instruments, or goals.

### Insight 5: Non-targeted Use

**Observation:**
One example of non-targeted use could be a user creating a post with non-music related content or inappropriate content.

**Design Modifications:**
To avoid this, we could add a feature that allows users to “flag” any posts that they think should be taken down, and indicate why they think it should be taken down. We could also remind users before they create a post of the kinds of posts that are allowed in the app, and let them know their account could be taken down if they don't comply with this.

## Storyboarding and Sketching

### Storyboard 1:

![storyboard 1 image](/../assets/images/storyboard1.png)

This storyboard shows someone who wants to learn how to play a new song on the guitar, but isn't sure where to start. They look for posts on the app for inspiration, and realize they can filter their feed to just show guitar songs. They find a post for a song that they want to learn, and then use the tutorials/sheet music associated with the post to learn how to play it themselves. They are happy because they can now play the song they liked, and then they show it to their friends. :)

### Storyboard 2:

![storyboard 2 image](/../assets/images/storyboard2.png)
This storyboard shows someone listening to a song on some headphones and wondering if there are any other covers of the song. They find that there are no published covers by recording artists, but they look it up using the search bar in the app, and find that there are posts from people in the app who aren't professional artists but are just practicing their own versions of the song. They find a post that they like, and save it in their account, so they can come back later to learn the song. :)
