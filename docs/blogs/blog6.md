# Response to Iris's Blog Post

Both Lyle’s lecture and Iris’s reflections raise important questions about design responsibility. In Iris’s post she highlights the difficulty of anticipating the harmful effects of a product and the tendency to overlook consequences that don’t have an immediate impact on our daily lives. This made me consider what mechanisms can encourage desginers/buisnesses to proactively address potential impacts.

In class in the 6-pack ring example, we talked about using ethical design as a marketing strategy. By promoting a product as using responsible/ethical practices it can make more consumers want to buy it, and the product could actually be more profitable. Another systemic approach to the problem could be implementing regulatory frameworks like environmental certifications or tax incentives that could help smaller companies afford to invest in ethical design practices. By lowering fincancial barriers, these policies would the support smaller businesses that want to design responsibly but lack the resources, which Iris was mentioning in her post.

Larger businesses which often have the resources but lack the motivation, can also be influenced by consumer advocacy. When consumers prioritize brands that align with their values, companies often respond by shifting their strategies to preserve their reputation. For instance, Coca-Cola faced growing consumer pressure about its contribution to plastic pollution, and in response, they committed to producing 25% of Coca-Cola beverages in refillable or returnable packaging by 2030. What other things can encourage both large and small buisinesses to address potential negative impacts of their products?
