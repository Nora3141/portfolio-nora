# User-Testing & Analysis

In this assignment, I plan and conduct two user-tests for Strumly.

## Pre-populated Data

I started this assignment by pre-populating Strumly with some realistic user data. To do this, I created three different accounts and on each of them made some different posts, added tags to posts, and favorited some posts. For the post-content I recorded videos of myself playing some different instruments (guitar, piano, drums) and uploaded these with realistic titles and descriptions. These are the kinds of posts that would end up being created in a real-version of my app. For each of them I added the correct corresponding tags. Additionally, by using multiple accounts I had one user "remix" a post of another user to demonstrate this featuer in a realistic way. Below is a screenshot of one of the posts I uploaded in this first task.

As a quick note, there is currently some unrealistic data on Strumly that was uploaded by the user-testers during this assignment. The user-testing sessions were just focused on the user-interaction and experience with the website, so the data they ended up uploading during the "Create Post" task was not very realistic. The user tester's usernames in Strumly are _Frogdog_ and ---, but posts by all other usernames should be realistic.

## Task List

Below is the list of tasks given to each user-tester.

### Task 1

**Task:** Create an Account

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your first task is to try to create a new account._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- Being logged into an account is necessary to access many of the features of my app. Since the user-tester won’t have an account yet, they should try to create one.
- Hopefully the create account/login feature of my app is discoverable and the interface for logging in is intuitive. This task will test this.
- I expect this to be a relatively easy task (compared to the others in this list). It is first to help the user get acquainted with the user-testing process.

### Task 2

**Task:** View any Trending Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task will be opening a trending post. For this task, you should try to open any post you want that’s in a trending box on the home page. Once you’ve navigated to the post, try to watch through its video, and then try to read out loud its “About” description._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- Viewing posts is a main feature of the app, by opening a trending post, we are testing the user experience doing this.
- The trending boxes were placed intentionally to try to be discoverable by the user and use familiar interaction. Hopefully the user is able to find them and figure out how to interact with them (watchign videos, and finding about description)
- This task also gives an introduction to what the posts on Strumly are like, which is important to have before creating a new post

---

### Task 3

**Task:** Favorite a Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to favorite the post that you opened. Once you have favorited it, confirm that you are able to see it on the “favorited” section of your profile._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- I attempted to use familiar icons/interaction for favoriting posts in my app, but the user-testing will help test whether it is actually intuitive (which it might not be because the button for favoriting isn’t labeled)
- Navigating to the different pages of my app is an important feature. In this task, the user tests this by trying to navigate to the Profile page. This is one of the more difficult pages to navigate to because it is hidden in the dropdown.

---

### Task 4

**Task:** Create a New Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to create your own post. You can use whatever media you would like, that you are okay with being public on this website._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- I think this will be one of the most difficult tasks to complete because it involves multiple steps. This will test whether the directions given in the “Create” page are clear enough to direct the user.
- This task is important to include because being able to upload media to Strumly is a main way of interacting with the app.

---

### Task 5

**Task:** Open Your Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to find the post you just made on your profile. Once you have found it, you should open the post from here._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- This task will set up the following tasks of the user-testing (so that after completing the task the user is inside their post in the feed)
- It will also test whether the user is able to figure out where the “my posts” list is in Strumly (whether or not it’s discoverable)

---

### Task 6

**Task:** Add Tags to Your Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to add any tag to your post._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- This task involves opening the side panel of the post and pressing any of the +tag buttons. It may be difficult for the user to find these since they are hidden in the panel.
- Something that might confuse the user is the filtering tag buttons at the top of the feed page which do not correspond to the +tag buttons. This task will test whether or not this conceptual difference is clear in my app.

---

### Task 7

**Task:** Go Through Feed Using Filtering

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to add a tag filter to your feed. Choose any tag filter you like and then try to use the feed to view some different posts that include this tag._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- This is again testing whether there is a clear conceptual difference between the filtering and adding tags buttons
- It is also testing whether or not the user can figure out how to move to the next post in the feed. This may be confusing because my app doesn’t use scrolling, which is a familiar way of navigating feeds in social media apps.

---

### Task 8

**Task:** Remix a Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to “remix” a post. You may again remix the post with whatever media you would like that you are okay with being public._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- I am unsure if users will be able to find the remix button in my app since right now it isn’t labeled (just an icon), and this concept is not common on other social media apps.
- This will test whether users will be able to understand what the remix concept is doing and whether they are able to figure out the interaction process for remixing a post.
- The remixing feature is important to test because it promotes collaboration between users, which was one of the main goals of my app.

---

### Task 9

**Task:** Search for a Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your final task is to attempt to search for a post by its title and access it from your search._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- The searching feature is tested last since by now the user will have seen some different posts within the app that they could use the title for
- I think this will be one of the easier tasks to complete, but it is important to test because this feature lets experienced users find specific posts faster. This task will check if the search box is discoverable, and the interaction for searching (with enter instead of a submit button) is intuitive.

### End Reflection

_Do you have any final reflections on what worked well and what was confusing or challenging?_

## Study Reports

### Participant 1: Katya

This user-test started off with a moment of difficulty during the initial task. After being prompted to “create an account”, Katya was immediately able to navigate to the login/register page. I watched her enter some credentials and press the create user button, and she noticed the success notification appeared on the screen. However, the page did not change which confused both Katya and me since this was not the behavior I’d experienced during testing on my own. Given this unexpected behavior, I prompted Katya to try logging in again to her account, and she was able to do this on her own successfully.

Katya went through many of the following tasks without much difficulty. She immediately understood how to interact with the trending boxes, using their scrolling behavior to find a post she liked before clicking on it to open it. When presented with the “favoriting” task, she understood she could click on the unlabeled star icon to favorite a post, and then after spending a short time looking through the navigation bar, was able to access her profile and find her favorited post there.

The next task which she had some difficulty with was the “Create Post” task. She was able to create a post on her own successfully, but I noticed she showed some frustration in the many steps involved just to upload her file. To upload her file, Katya ended up recording a video on her phone, uploading it to google drive on her phone, sending herself the link through Messages so she could access it from her computer, and then put this link into Strumly. In testing on my own, I had gotten practiced at doing this quickly, but this user-test highlights the complexity and drawn-out nature of this task. In the future, an possible way to improve the user-experience would be to not use google drive for storing files, but instead allow users to upload them directly, shortening this process. Also during the “Create Post” task, I noticed that Katya seemed a bit confused about the difference between the “About” vs “Credit” section. She first entered what would be the credits of her post into the “About” section before later deciding to change it. This shows that the instructions in these sections could maybe be written clearer to help users understand what they are for.

Katya completed most of the remaining tasks relatively easily, but a final one she had some difficulty with was navigating the feed page when prompted with the task to add a filter. I watched her first spend some time looking for a button she could do this with on the feed page before eventually finding the filtering tag buttons. When she clicked one of the filtering buttons she was confused why the page wasn't immediately updating. It took some time before she eventually found the “next” button and was able to understand the functionality behind this concept. This shows me that the feed page could be better layed out to help the user understand how to interact with it. Katya also attempted to scroll on this page to get to the next post, which is a familiar way navigate other social media apps. To improve the user-experience and ease of understanding, I should also maybe implement this scrolling behavior.

These were some of Katya’s final reflections after completing all of the tasks:

- Difficulty understanding the feed layout - didn’t see the next button and it wasn’t immediately clear to her what this was for
- Compared this button to the button in the “trending” boxes which she felt like was easy to find and clear for what she was supposed to do
- Confusion at why registering her account did not immediately navigate to a new page
- Liked the layout of the home page, especially the image thumbnails that got displayed for each of the posts

### Participant 2: Fatima

For the first task, Fatima was able to successfully create an account by quickly finding the register/login button and entering some credentials. Though in the first user test there was some unexpected behavior on this step, the problem did not reoccur. Fatima also went through the next few tasks on her own pretty easily. She was able to navigate the trending boxes using the arrows, opened a post by clicking on it, and watched through the post’s video. Though it took her a moment of searching, she was able to relatively quickly find the “About” section on a post by clicking on the info icon. After finding this for the first time, she later in the user test continued accessing the info section of posts without difficulty.

One of the main challenges that came up in this user-test was confusion during the “Create a Remix” task. Fatima first spent a while trying to find the button on a post to create a remix of it. Eventually she seemed stuck so I directed her on where this button was. This shows me that the button could be made clearer to the user, maybe by increasing its size or changing its position on the page. Also right now it is just an icon but since remixing is a pretty unfamiliar concept, I think it would be more helpful to change it into a text label. As Fatima continued through this task, she explained to me that she felt confused about what the idea behind the “remixing” concept was. After pressing the create button on her remix, she was surprised that a new post was created and told me that she was expecting it to edit the original. A way I could improve Strumly to make this concept more intuitive could be having more direct instructions and information on the “create” page when you are remixing a post to explain the difference between a remixed post and an original one.
Another one of the more challenging tasks during this user-test was the filtering search task. Like Katya in my previous user-test, Fatima also did not immediately understand how the navigation of posts in the feed worked. I watched her click on some tag filters at the top of the page and she explained to me that she was confused why the page did not update after these clicks. She eventually did also find the “next” button on her own and understood what was happening, but this user test further highlights the need to restructure the layout of the feed page to make this interaction more intuitive.

These were some of Fatima’s final reflections after completing all of the tasks

- Confusion from the concept of remixing. Mentioned that this was probably made more confusing because she didn’t initially understand that Strumly was a music-related app
- Expected the feed page to update after clicking a filter. Also didn’t initially understand that the feed page would be a string of multiple posts (thought it was just opening one).
- Liked that after creating a post, it directs you to your profile where you can view it

## Design Flaws & Opportunities

- **Confusing Layout of Feed Page (major severity, conceptual)**

  **What is occuring:** Users are not finding the interaction with the feed page intuitive to move between different posts. Specific difficulties include not seeing the "Next" button, not understanding the function of this button, expecting scrolling behavior, and not realizing the feed page contians multiple posts.

  **Why is it occuring:** Many social media apps use scrolling as a common way in a feed to navigate betewen posts. Strumly's use of the "Next" button is an unfamiliar way of interacting with this page. Additionally, besides the small down arrow on the next button, there is no clear indication that there are more posts on this page other than the one that is currently open.

  **Possible changes to address it:** Scrolling could be implemented to use a more familiar interaction. Instructions like "scroll down for more posts" or a larger icon could be put on this screen to help users understand there are more posts to view than just the one that is currently open. Another indicator that could help is putting the top section of the next post at the bottom of the screen (below the currently open one), so the user knows they can scroll down to view it.

- **Difficulty Uploading Media to Create Posts (moderate severity, physical)**

  **What is occuring:** The multi-step process involved for uploading media (taking a video, uploading it to google drive, making it publicly accessible, copying the google drive link, putting it into Strumly), creates difficulty and makes it frustrating for users to upload posts.

  **Why is it occuring:** The many steps involved leave places for the user to make a mistake. The mistakes they can make are recoverable (ex: they can delete a post and try again with corrected media), but make the process feel drawn-out and complicated. Additionally having to switch between different applications (camera, google drive, web browser), can make this process feel more complicated.

  **Possible changes to address it:** By storing video data directly in the MongoDB, users would be able to skip the Google Drive step of this process (instead taking a video and uploading it directly to the app). Additoinally, if this application were turned into a mobile app, users would already be on their phones when using it, so they could more easily access their camera.

- **Lack of Immediate Page Updates in Feed (minor severity, linguistic)**

  **What is occuring:** When users try to add a tag to filter their feed, they are confused why the page does not immediately update with a filtered version of what they are viewing. Additionally, when users press the "Next" button, which generates a random post, occasionally the randomly generated post will be the same as the previously opened one, and users will be confused why this screen did not update. This is marked as minor severity because when trying to fix these problems the user will tend to just press the next post button on their own, which will solve the problem.

  **Why is it occuring:** When interacting with the site, users expect that their clicks on buttons or different parts of the page will have visible effects. Even though in these situations their actions are causing things to occur in the back-end, there is no change in what the user is seeing on screen and it leaves them feeling confused.

  **Possible changes to address it:** Modifications could be made to the front end so that users will see immediate updates in these situations. When a user changes the current applied filter tags, this could automatically get a new post in the feed that has these filters (instead of waiting for the user to press "Next"). When the user presses the "Next" button, the randomized post generator could be modified to not show the user the same post two times in a row (or if it is the only post with the current applied filters, it could display an alert message to the user to notify them of this).
