# User-Testing & Analysis

In this assignment, I plan and conduct two user-tests for Strumly.

## Pre-populated Data

I started this assignment by pre-populating Strumly with some realistic user data. To do this, I created three different accounts and on each of them made some different posts, added tags to posts, and favorited some posts. For the post-content I recorded videos of myself playing some different instruments (guitar, piano, drums) and uploaded these with realistic titles and descriptions. These are the kinds of posts that would end up being created in a real-version of my app. For each of them I added the correct corresponding tags. Additionally, by using multiple accounts I had one user "remix" a post of another user to demonstrate this featuer in a realistic way. Below is a screenshot of one of the posts I uploaded in this first task.

## Task List

Below is the introduction given to each user-tester and list of tasks.

---

### Introduction

_Thank you for participating in the user-testing of Strumly! In this user-testing you’ll be asked to try to perform a series of tasks within the app. To be clear, this user-testing is solely an evaluation on the design of our app, and not at all an evaluation of you. You are also free to choose to leave this user testing at any time._

_Throughout the session, you are encouraged to try to think out loud or try to verbally explain what you are doing. If there is a task you get stuck on, I will first give you some time to try to figure it out on your own. If you still are truly stuck, I can intervene to give you some guidance._

_Let’s get started! Is it okay if I record this session?_

### Task 1

**Task:** Create an Account

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your first task is to try to create a new account._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- Being logged into an account is necessary to access many of the features of my app. Since the user-tester won’t have an account yet, they should try to create one.
- Hopefully the create account/login feature of my app is discoverable and the interface for logging in is intuitive. This task will test this.
- I expect this to be a relatively easy task (compared to the others in this list). It is first to help the user get acquainted with the user-testing process.

### Task 2

**Task:** View any Trending Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task will be opening a trending post. For this task, you should try to open any post you want that’s in a trending box on the home page. Once you’ve navigated to the post, try to watch through its video, and then try to read out loud its “About” description._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- Viewing posts is a main feature of the app, by opening a trending post, we are testing the user experience doing this.
- The trending boxes were placed intentionally to try to be discoverable by the user and use familiar interaction. Hopefully the user is able to find them and figure out how to interact with them (watchign videos, and finding about description)
- This task also gives an introduction to what the posts on Strumly are like, which is important to have before creating a new post

---

### Task 3

**Task:** Favorite a Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to favorite the post that you opened. Once you have favorited it, confirm that you are able to see it on the “favorited” section of your profile._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- I attempted to use familiar icons/interaction for favoriting posts in my app, but the user-testing will help test whether it is actually intuitive (which it might not be because the button for favoriting isn’t labeled)
- Navigating to the different pages of my app is an important feature. In this task, the user tests this by trying to navigate to the Profile page. This is one of the more difficult pages to navigate to because it is hidden in the dropdown.

---

### Task 4

**Task:** Create a New Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to create your own post. You can use whatever media you would like, that you are okay with being public on this website._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- I think this will be one of the most difficult tasks to complete because it involves multiple steps. This will test whether the directions given in the “Create” page are clear enough to direct the user.
- This task is important to include because being able to upload media to Strumly is a main way of interacting with the app.

---

### Task 5

**Task:** Open Your Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to find the post you just made on your profile. Once you have found it, you should open the post from here._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- This task will set up the following tasks of the user-testing (so that after completing the task the user is inside their post in the feed)
- It will also test whether the user is able to figure out where the “my posts” list is in Strumly (whether or not it’s discoverable)

---

### Task 6

**Task:** Add Tags to Your Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to add any tag to your post._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- This task involves opening the side panel of the post and pressing any of the +tag buttons. It may be difficult for the user to find these since they are hidden in the panel.
- Something that might confuse the user is the filtering tag buttons at the top of the feed page which do not correspond to the +tag buttons. This task will test whether or not this conceptual difference is clear in my app.

---

### Task 7

**Task:** Go Through Feed Using Filtering

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to add a tag filter to your feed. Choose any tag filter you like and then try to use the feed to view some different posts that include this tag._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- This is again testing whether there is a clear conceptual difference between the filtering and adding tags buttons
- It is also testing whether or not the user can figure out how to move to the next post in the feed. This may be confusing because my app doesn’t use scrolling, which is a familiar way of navigating feeds in social media apps.

---

### Task 8

**Task:** Remix a Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to “remix” a post. You may again remix the post with whatever media you would like that you are okay with being public._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- I am unsure if users will be able to find the remix button in my app since right now it isn’t labeled (just an icon), and this concept is not common on other social media apps.
- This will test whether users will be able to understand what the remix concept is doing and whether they are able to figure out the interaction process for remixing a post.
- The remixing feature is important to test because it promotes collaboration between users, which was one of the main goals of my app.

---

### Task 9

**Task:** Search for a Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your final task is to attempt to search for a post by its title and access it from your search._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- The searching feature is tested last since by now the user will have seen some different posts within the app that they could use the title for
- I think this will be one of the easier tasks to complete, but it is important to test because this feature lets experienced users find specific posts faster. This task will check if the search box is discoverable, and the interaction for searching (with enter instead of a submit button) is intuitive.
