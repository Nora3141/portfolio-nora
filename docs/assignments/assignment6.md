# User-Testing & Analysis

In this assignment, I plan and conduct two user-tests for Strumly.

## Pre-populated Data

I started this assignment by pre-populating Strumly with some realistic user data. To do this, I created three different accounts and on each of them made some different posts, added tags to posts, and favorited some posts. For the post-content I recorded videos of myself playing some different instruments (guitar, piano, drums) and uploaded these with realistic titles and descriptions. These are the kinds of posts that would end up being created in a real-version of my app. For each of them I added the correct corresponding tags. Additionally, by using multiple accounts I had one user "remix" a post of another user to demonstrate this featuer in a realistic way. Below is a screenshot of one of the posts I uploaded in this first task.

As a quick note, there is currently some unrealistic data on Strumly that was uploaded by the user-testers during this assignment. The user-testing sessions were just focused on the user-interaction and experience with the website, so the data they ended up uploading during the "Create Post" task was not very realistic. The user tester's usernames in Strumly are _Frogdog_ and ---, but posts by all other usernames should be realistic.

## Task List

Below is the list of tasks given to each user-tester.

### Task 1

**Task:** Create an Account

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your first task is to try to create a new account._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- Being logged into an account is necessary to access many of the features of my app. Since the user-tester won’t have an account yet, they should try to create one.
- Hopefully the create account/login feature of my app is discoverable and the interface for logging in is intuitive. This task will test this.
- I expect this to be a relatively easy task (compared to the others in this list). It is first to help the user get acquainted with the user-testing process.

### Task 2

**Task:** View any Trending Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task will be opening a trending post. For this task, you should try to open any post you want that’s in a trending box on the home page. Once you’ve navigated to the post, try to watch through its video, and then try to read out loud its “About” description._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- Viewing posts is a main feature of the app, by opening a trending post, we are testing the user experience doing this.
- The trending boxes were placed intentionally to try to be discoverable by the user and use familiar interaction. Hopefully the user is able to find them and figure out how to interact with them (watchign videos, and finding about description)
- This task also gives an introduction to what the posts on Strumly are like, which is important to have before creating a new post

---

### Task 3

**Task:** Favorite a Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to favorite the post that you opened. Once you have favorited it, confirm that you are able to see it on the “favorited” section of your profile._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- I attempted to use familiar icons/interaction for favoriting posts in my app, but the user-testing will help test whether it is actually intuitive (which it might not be because the button for favoriting isn’t labeled)
- Navigating to the different pages of my app is an important feature. In this task, the user tests this by trying to navigate to the Profile page. This is one of the more difficult pages to navigate to because it is hidden in the dropdown.

---

### Task 4

**Task:** Create a New Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to create your own post. You can use whatever media you would like, that you are okay with being public on this website._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- I think this will be one of the most difficult tasks to complete because it involves multiple steps. This will test whether the directions given in the “Create” page are clear enough to direct the user.
- This task is important to include because being able to upload media to Strumly is a main way of interacting with the app.

---

### Task 5

**Task:** Open Your Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to find the post you just made on your profile. Once you have found it, you should open the post from here._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- This task will set up the following tasks of the user-testing (so that after completing the task the user is inside their post in the feed)
- It will also test whether the user is able to figure out where the “my posts” list is in Strumly (whether or not it’s discoverable)

---

### Task 6

**Task:** Add Tags to Your Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to try to add any tag to your post._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- This task involves opening the side panel of the post and pressing any of the +tag buttons. It may be difficult for the user to find these since they are hidden in the panel.
- Something that might confuse the user is the filtering tag buttons at the top of the feed page which do not correspond to the +tag buttons. This task will test whether or not this conceptual difference is clear in my app.

---

### Task 7

**Task:** Go Through Feed Using Filtering

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to add a tag filter to your feed. Choose any tag filter you like and then try to use the feed to view some different posts that include this tag._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- This is again testing whether there is a clear conceptual difference between the filtering and adding tags buttons
- It is also testing whether or not the user can figure out how to move to the next post in the feed. This may be confusing because my app doesn’t use scrolling, which is a familiar way of navigating feeds in social media apps.

---

### Task 8

**Task:** Remix a Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your next task is to “remix” a post. You may again remix the post with whatever media you would like that you are okay with being public._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- I am unsure if users will be able to find the remix button in my app since right now it isn’t labeled (just an icon), and this concept is not common on other social media apps.
- This will test whether users will be able to understand what the remix concept is doing and whether they are able to figure out the interaction process for remixing a post.
- The remixing feature is important to test because it promotes collaboration between users, which was one of the main goals of my app.

---

### Task 9

**Task:** Search for a Post

**Introduction Given to User:** _Your final task is to attempt to search for a post by its title and access it from your search._

**Rationale for Including Task:**

- The searching feature is tested last since by now the user will have seen some different posts within the app that they could use the title for
- I think this will be one of the easier tasks to complete, but it is important to test because this feature lets experienced users find specific posts faster. This task will check if the search box is discoverable, and the interaction for searching (with enter instead of a submit button) is intuitive.

### End Reflection

_Do you have any final reflections on what worked well and what was confusing or challenging?_

## Study Reports

### Participant 1: Katya

This user-test started off with a moment of difficulty during the initial task. After being prompted to “create an account”, Katya was immediately able to navigate to the login/register page. I watched her enter some credentials and press the create user button, and she noticed the success notification appeared on the screen. However, the page did not change which confused both Katya and me since this was not the behavior I’d experienced during testing on my own. Given this unexpected behavior, I prompted Katya to try logging in again to her account, and she was able to do this on her own successfully.

Katya went through many of the following tasks without much difficulty. She immediately understood how to interact with the trending boxes, using their scrolling behavior to find a post she liked before clicking on it to open it. When presented with the “favoriting” task, she understood she could click on the unlabeled star icon to favorite a post, and then after spending a short time looking through the navigation bar, was able to access her profile and find her favorited post there.

The next task which she had some difficulty with was the “Create Post” task. She was able to create a post on her own successfully, but I noticed she showed some frustration in the many steps involved just to upload her file. To upload her file, Katya ended up recording a video on her phone, uploading it to google drive on her phone, sending herself the link through Messages so she could access it from her computer, and then put this link into Strumly. In testing on my own, I had gotten practiced at doing this quickly, but this user-test highlights the complexity and drawn-out nature of this task. In the future, an possible way to improve the user-experience would be to not use google drive for storing files, but instead allow users to upload them directly, shortening this process. Also during the “Create Post” task, I noticed that Katya seemed a bit confused about the difference between the “About” vs “Credit” section. She first entered what would be the credits of her post into the “About” section before later deciding to change it. This shows that the instructions in these sections could maybe be written clearer to help users understand what they are for.

Katya completed most of the remaining tasks relatively easily, but a final one she had some difficulty with was navigating the feed page when prompted with the task to add a filter. I watched her first spend some time looking for a button she could do this with on the feed page before eventually finding the filtering tag buttons. When she clicked one of the filtering buttons she was confused why the page wasn't immediately updating. It took some time before she eventually found the “next” button and was able to understand the functionality behind this concept. This shows me that the feed page could be better layed out to help the user understand how to interact with it. Katya also attempted to scroll on this page to get to the next post, which is a familiar way navigate other social media apps. To improve the user-experience and ease of understanding, I should also maybe implement this scrolling behavior.

These were some of Katya’s final reflections after completing all of the tasks:

- Difficulty understanding the feed layout - didn’t see the next button and it wasn’t immediately clear to her what this was for
- Compared this button to the button in the “trending” boxes which she felt like was easy to find and clear for what she was supposed to do
- Confusion at why registering her account did not immediately navigate to a new page
- Liked the layout of the home page, especially the image thumbnails that got displayed for each of the posts

### Participant 2: Fatima

## Design Flaws & Opportunities

- **Confusing Layout of Feed Page:** Both user-testers experienced ... (TODO)
- **Difficulty Uploading Media to Create Posts:** (TODO)
